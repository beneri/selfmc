# Self-modifying code (SelfMC)
SelfMC is in essence a class for writing and reading data from the file itself, i.e. self-modifying code.
This could for example be used to create persistent variables as shown in [views](examples/views/) example.
Another possibility is to combine multiple files into a single file, as shown in the  [multipleFiles](examples/multipleFiles/) example. 
Or, as is currently implemented in selfmc.php, a swiss army knife of your favorite PHP tools.
