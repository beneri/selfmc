# selfmc
selfmc.php is in essence a class for writing and reading data from the file itself, i.e. self-modifying code.
This could for example be used to create persistent variables as shown in [a relative link](examples/views/).
Another possibility is to combine multiple files into a single file handler, as shown in  [a relative link](examples/multipleFiles/). 
Or, as is currently implemented in selfmc.php, a swiss army knife of your favorite PHP tools.
